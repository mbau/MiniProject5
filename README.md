============

Completed Mini Project 5. Project requirements can be found here: http://www3.nd.edu/~cse/2013fa/40814/projects.html

Project Guidelines:

In this mini project, you will integrate your app with a back-end service such as parse.com. You will add the following features to your app:
The ability to sign up as a user using the back-end service and to log into or out of the service.
The ability to upload the taken images (and possibly other information) to the back-end service.
To obtain a list of information from the service such as a list of pictures taken by other users.
The ability to download some piece of information (e.g., a specific photo) from the service onto your device.
For testing purposes, you may either need two devices (or a simulator plus a device, etc.) or you can coordinate with your colleagues to test each others apps.
